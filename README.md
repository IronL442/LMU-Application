# Inventory Management System

## Overview
This Inventory Management System is a simple GUI-based application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. It allows users to manage a basic inventory of products including adding new products, selling products, restocking products, and viewing transactions. The system also provides financial calculations like total revenue, total costs, inventory value, and total profit.

## Features
- Add new products to the inventory.
- Sell products and update inventory accordingly.
- Restock products with updated purchase costs.
- View all transactions related to sales and restocking.
- Calculate total revenue, total costs, inventory value, and total profit.
- Display the value of inventory for a specific product.

## Prerequisites
Before running this application, ensure that you have Python installed on your system. The application is built using Python 3.10.4. Additionally, tkinter needs to be installed on the system. 

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Running the Application
If you are a Windows user, just start the app.exe file to run this application.

Alternatively, to run this application, navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command:
```bash
python inventory_system.py
```
## How to Use
Start the application using the command above.
Use the GUI buttons to interact with the inventory system:
- Show Inventory: Displays current inventory.
- Add Product: Adds a new product to the inventory.
- Sell Product: Sells a specified quantity of a product.
- Restock Product: Restocks a specified quantity of a product.
- Show Transactions: Displays a log of all transactions.
- Calculate Totals: Allows selection from several financial calculations.
- Show Product Value: Displays the inventory value of a specified product.

### Acknowledgements
- This project uses the Tkinter library for the GUI implementation, which is part of Python's standard library.
- Random data generation for initial inventory setup is achieved using Python's random module.
